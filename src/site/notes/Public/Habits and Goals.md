## Habits & Goals

Those are my current running systems:
* 🧘 Mediation. I invest 30m daily with my Headspace account. Can't be more grateful for discovering the habit. Since 2020
* 📚 Reading.  Working at Kindle pushed me to be surrounded by "books people". I learned to appreciate the industry and how much it benefits. Since 2020, I dedicate 30m daily in the morning to read Non Fiction from a large [GoodReads wishlist](https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/34510708-jose-leiva)
* 🏃‍♂️Running. 3/w. Currently on 5 Km - 10 Km - 15 Km per week. My 2023 goal is to keep 1,500 Km a year and strong enough complete half a marathon below 130', overall without getting injured.  I got 800Km in 2021 and 1600Km in 2022. 
* 🏋️Weight Lifting. 2/w. Fully engaged for 2 years with my Fitbod account. I started a home and jumped into the gym in 2022
* 🏊 Swimming.  1/w. I'm a bad swimmer, you can't figure how much. But my son became a waterpolo local team member a year ago and I still want to decently (minimally?) keep up. My goal is to survive finishing 4 KM free style for now.
* 🥋 Aikido. 2/w.  For a while in my life, now coming back. 

Where am I struggling with?
* 😴 Sleeping. Mid 2021, I decided to start waking up 5 AM. The amount of time I got for my was impressive, but struggle to get to 6 hours of sleep, not enough. In 2022, I shifted a bit to 6:00 AM getting some more time, ~6hr/day, not enough. I need 30m more minutes a day and still suffer to got to bed earlier to 11 PM for family reasons. 2023 will be the year to get that time back. 
* 🧑‍💻 Coding. I miss it a lot but never find the time. To feel productive, I need decent non-context-switching chunk of time. With my job and family that is difficult, and will remain this way for some time.  Solution?  I need a system. Maybe daily hour of coding. Thinking about it.
