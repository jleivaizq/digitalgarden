# Hi there ðŸ‘‹

Welcome to my digital garden ðŸŒ±

I have been reflecting about the best way to share the tiny and humble things I work on my free time and did not get to anything interesting.  Snooping around, I learned about digital garden and decided to give it a try. 

## About me ðŸ™‹

Overall, ==I love spending time with family==. Having dinner together and ending up slept while I hug my son in our couch over a movie is my idea of a great Friday night. 
Â 
Alone, I enjoy running, reading and meditating early in the morning, if possible during sunrise; that is my best reason to wake up. Apart from that, I enjoy practicing Aikido, after 10 years, bb 2nd dan, I stopped because of the hustle. Now coming back...

Apart from that, I am also an ...

**Engineer** in soul. I completed my Bachelor Degree in the [Technical University of Madrid](https://www.fi.upm.es/).  Still remember those years as the best of my career. I enjoyed every challenge, became a proud member of the local ACM chapter.  I also met my wife. Yes! I'm married with an Engineer, beat it ðŸ˜˜

**Avid learner**, curious by default. Some years after finishing my degree, I completed an MBA at [ie University](https://www.ie.edu/).  Some time afterward, I went through a UX Master in [La Nave Nodriza](https://lanavenodriza.com/) The outcome of this? I learn to appreciate the work Product Managers, UX Designers, Marketing and Sales Manager. Now, I love building with them. Yes, although I learned a lot, I'm [Tom Builder](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Pillars_of_the_Earth)

**Engineer Manager**. I'm proud of every project I worked on, from my time working in surveillance systems at Plettac, working as SharePoint consultant at Exevi,  deploying banking system in South America at Prosegur, building a startup from the ground up with a great team of engineers a still enjoy having dinner with, building the future of procurement systems in Amazon Business and now whispering your next dream book at Kindle.  I like creating things, but I love  growing engineers to crate them together. 

My dream?  Create my own company. Unfortunately, I still don't have the luxury of failing twice. Too many people depend on me.  I do not want to be financially independent to get retired, I want it to start from scratch once and again.
